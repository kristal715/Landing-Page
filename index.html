        <h2>Homebuying Tips</h2>
        <p>Buying a home can be both exhilarating and overwhelming. It’s a multi-step process that requires careful
          planning and diligence. For most people, buying a home is the largest investment they will ever make in a
          lifetime. For this reason, home buyers should seek the assistance of a real estate professional to help them
          successfully navigate through the home buying process and to avoid making costly mistakes they could regret.

        </p>

        <p>For your search to be successful and to make it clear what type of property you are looking for, you should
          draft a property “wish list” with your “must have” and “would be nice to have” features for your future home.
          Your wish list should have lots of details. The better you know what you are looking for, the more focus your
          search will be. </p>

        <h2>Looking To sell?</h2>
        <p>Unless you plan to keep your home as an investment, buying another house will typically mean selling the one
          you’re in currently. From staking out the “For Sale” sign to arranging closing day, here are the steps you can
          expect to take when selling a house. Take a tour around the neighborhood: Odds are, you’re not the only
          homeowner selling your house in the area. If you’re struggling to find an agent, try contacting the numbers
          you see on “For Sale” signs around the neighborhood. You can also tour an open house and introduce yourself to
          the agent hosting the event.</p>

        <p>Determining a fair asking price for your home is one of the more challenging aspects of selling real estate.
          You need to make sure that you set the price high enough to provide a good return on your investment and low
          enough to get potential buyers’ attention. To find a price that’s just right, you must know how much your home
          is worth.
          To figure out the fair market value of a home, real estate agents run a comparative market analysis (CMA).
          Whether you’re in the market as a seller or buyer, this tool is extremely useful to understand.</p>

        <h2>Your Agent</h2>
        <p>Living my best life in Charlotte, NC as a real estate agent of 10 years. I have 3 teenagers 2 who are in high
          school, 1 in college and an adult son who has made me a glam ma.</p>

        <p>Buying my home in Charlotte was the best decision I have made so far. The city is growing at a rapid paste
          and laves room for retirement. By offering my services as a native I hope to bring a little bit of hometown
          feel to any home I buy or sell.</p>
